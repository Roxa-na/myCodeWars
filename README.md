# myCodeWars
This repository is created to hold the codewars solution I code on a daily basis.
Codes are categorised by their Kata.
In the body of the code, first the question is given, then the answer follows. 
If any part required commenting, I have provided it. 
Also, whenever a better or more clever solution was given I added that as well. some of them were too good!!!! :D
